# Browsing sentences

You can search for sentences using the screen under _Tools > InContext > Browse sentences_.

![Browse screen](media/browse.png)

You can also assign shortcuts to open the Browse screen for the selected word in the review screen from the [settings](./settings.md).

Clicking on the clipboard icon next to the magnifying glass icon activates the _Clipboard Monitor_. This monitors your clipboard and automatically looks up copied text while the screen is open.
Note that text copied in the Browse screen itself doesn't trigger automatic lookups.
