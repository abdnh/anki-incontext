# Introduction

This Anki add-on allows you to fetch example sentences in different languages from various sources such as [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/).

It can be used to look up and browse sentences given a word, add sentences to a given field for a group of notes, or fetch and display random sentences when you review cards.

## Download

You can download the add-on using the [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/385420176) code `385420176` or from the [GitHub releases page](github.com/abdnh/anki-incontext/releases).

## Supported languages

More than 400+ languages are supported. Most of them only have Tatoeba as a supported provider at the moment, but a few languages such as English, Japanese and Turkish have additional providers.
To contribute additional providers or suggest some resources, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/abdnh/anki-incontext/issues).

Go to _Tools > InContext > Languages_ for a complete list of supported languages and providers.

## Usage

Go to the relevant page for usage:

- [Browsing sentences](./browse.md).
- [Filling in sentences in bulk](./fill.md).
- [Displaying random sentences while reviewing](./review.md).

## Importing Tatoeba databases

Using the Tatoeba provider requires downloading the sentences first. Use _Tools > InContext > Download Tatoeba sentences_ to download sentences for your target language.
